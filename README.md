# Introduction to Computer Science and Modular Programming

Welcome to my teaching repository for the first-year courses on Introduction to Computer Science and Modular Programming at Hadassah Academic College (HAC). This collection of materials includes lecture notes and code examples I used during the 2023 academic year.

## Content Overview

This repository is meticulously organized to mirror the curriculum taught throughout the academic year. It spans from introductory topics in computer science to advanced programming concepts as for the modular programming course.
Its important to understand the syllabus of the courses to understand the content of the repository.
Which is equivalent to Yorams Biberman Website: [Yoram Biberman - Intro 2 cs + Modular programming](https://sites.google.com/view/yoramb-intro2cs/home)

This course is using Legacy CPP, which is much more similar to C than to C++ in some aspects.
