# Introduction to Computer Science and Modular Programming

Welcome to my teaching repository for the first-year courses on Introduction to Computer Science and Modular Programming at Hadassah Academic College (HAC). This collection of materials includes lecture notes and code examples I used during the 2023 academic year.

## How to Get Started

Feel free to clone this repo or explore the files directly on GitHub.
Each folder has examples and notes to help you grasp the concepts.
If you find the materials helpful, please give this repository a ⭐!

## Content Overview

This repository follows the curriculum we explored together and ranges from the basics of computer science to more complex topics in modular programming, akin to the content on [Yoram Biberman's site](https://sites.google.com/view/yoramb-intro2cs/home).
Some examples are based on Yoram's materials, while others are my own.
