# Modular Programming in C++

As we embark on our journey with **Modular Programming in C++**, it's essential to know where to find the resources and lectures for this course. They are available on [Yoram Biberman - Intro to cs](https://sites.google.com/view/yoramb-intro2cs/home), starting from episode 10 onwards.

## Personal Note
I just rewrote some of Yorams examples, with commenting through the code written. 
this was also a Zoom Live lesson, which wasnt recorded.
## Course Approach

Our focus will be on **understanding the core concepts** rather than delving deep into specific topics. This means we'll briefly explore some syntax, experiment with it, and swiftly move on to the next subject. It's about grasping the general idea behind each topic.

Remember, all the information and resources you need are consolidated in the [provided link](https://sites.google.com/view/yoramb-intro2cs/home). And rest assured, these concepts will be elaborated upon in the upcoming course. So, don't stress if everything doesn't click right away!

## Today's Agenda

We aim to cover some critical areas that will bolster your understanding of C++:

1. **Strings/chars**: Revisiting what might have been missed last semester.
2. **Working with files**: The intricacies of reading from and writing to files and reading from files.
3. **Basic Pointers**
4. **Structs**: Diving into what structs are with practical discussions and examples.

Should time permit, we may venture into the realm of **Linked lists**, although that remains an optimistic goal.

### Reminder


*If you Dont understand something, its totally okay!!!*
*You will learn this through the year*
