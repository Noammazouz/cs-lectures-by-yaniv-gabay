## General notes before the Test


### Tips

- **Read the question carefully**. Make sure you understand what is being asked. If you don't understand, ask the teacher.
- **Write like they like to write**. If the question asks for a function, write a function, with the correct signature and return type.
- also, think about the syntax Yoram likes to see. For example, he likes to see `int* arr` instead of `int *arr` , or `_memeber` instead of `member`.
- **Write notes to explain your mindset**. If you are not sure about the solution, write down your thoughts. It will help you to get partial credit, i wanted to do this, and than sort this, and extract this using this function, but i didn't have time to finish it etc.
